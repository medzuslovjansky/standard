Like most Slavic languages, nouns in Interslavic have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural) and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative). The vocative, used for addressing a person or object directly, is actually not a real case, as it behaves significantly different from other cases: it exists only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns, it never affects adjectives or pronouns, and it has nothing to do with the syntactic structure of the sentence.

Long and complicated paradigms are to be avoided, but we cannot escape distinguishing between a few different word classes. Basically, Interslavic has three declensions:

* The first declension includes all masculine nouns ending in a consonant, as well as neuter nouns ending in **-o** or **-e**.
* The second declension includes all feminine nouns on **-a**.
* The third declension all feminine nouns on a consonant.
* An optional fourth („athematic”) declension is discussed below.

Within the first declension, we distinguish between three types. This difference affects only the nominative, the accusative and the vocative:

* _Masculine animate_ (animals and male persons): the accusative is always identical to the genitive;
* _Masculine inanimate_ (all remaining masculine nouns): the accusative is always identical to the nominative;
* _Neuter_: the nominative, accusative and vocative are always identical.

Another distinction is made between hard and soft declension patterns.
Soft stems are stems ending in **š**, **ž**, **č**, **c**, **j**, **lj** or **nj**.
As a rule, after a soft stem the **-o** and **-y** of the ending become **-e**, the **-ě** becomes **-i**.

The basic endings are displayed in the table below. The forms between brackets are used after soft stems:
